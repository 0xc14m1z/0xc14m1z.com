    <p>
      I'm an experienced Frontend Developer with almost ten years of full stack projects behind me as a freelance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked with lots of different languages and frameworks over the course of the years, but I am settling with the React ecosystem since late 2015. I have extensive knowledge of Javascript/ES6, React, Redux and related technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keen to functional programming, my code is clean, understandable, maintainable and robust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m eager to constantly improve my skills using all the learning platforms available. Currently I am interested in Elm, ReasonML and Elixir.
