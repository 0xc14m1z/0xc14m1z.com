    <p>
      I'm an experienced Frontend Developer with more than ten years of full
      stack projects behind me as a freelance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked with lots of different languages and frameworks over the course
      of the years, but I am settling with the React ecosystem since late 2015.
      I have extensive knowledge of Javascript/ES6, React, Redux and related
      technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keen to functional programming, my code is clean, understandable,
      maintainable and robust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm eager to constantly improve my skills using all the learning platforms
      available. Currently I am interested in deepen my Javascript knowledge and
      studying functional programming languages like Elm for the frontend and
      Elixir for the backend.
