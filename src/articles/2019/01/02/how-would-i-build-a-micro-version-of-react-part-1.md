This little experimental project has come to my mind during a vacation in Costa
Rica. I was a bit struggling without almost any internet connection (accordingly
 to fast.com it was of about 800 bytes per second), and during a very bad
 weather moment I asked myself:

> how would I have written something like React?

I felt quite comfortable answering myself with general architecture and steps
but I also wanted to try everything out. I have no idea at all whether this
experiment will ever finish, but I am sure it will be very educational.

To add a bit of challenge in this (just because I have no idea of what I am
  doing), Iâ€™d like to implement everything in a "as munch functional" possible
  way.
